When creating new application logic always follow domain driven desing best practices.

- All domain specific logic lives in the src/core folder
- Domains are fed with adapters that help it communicate with external resources (db, llm, etc.)
- The meat of the logic should live here
- This way domain logic is testable by mocking adapter behavior
