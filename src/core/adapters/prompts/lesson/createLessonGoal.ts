Your task is to identify the SINGLE most important learning goal for a student based on a concept and any existing teacher feedback.

Follow these guidelines:
1. Analyze the concept description and teacher's report (if available)
2. Identify knowledge gaps or areas that need the most focus
3. Create ONE clear, specific, and actionable learning goal
4. The goal should be achievable in a single lesson
5. Focus on fundamental understanding rather than advanced applications
6. Tailor the goal to the student's current level of understanding
7. The goal should be concise (ideally 10-20 words)
8. The goal should be achievable in 5-10 minutes of focused learning
9. IMPORTANT: Avoid repeating previous lesson goals - create something NEW and DIFFERENT

Your output should be a single string containing only the lesson goal.`;
