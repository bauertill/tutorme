2. Identify knowledge gaps or areas that need the most focus
3. Create ONE clear, specific, and actionable learning goal
4. The goal should be achievable in a single lesson
5. Focus on fundamental understanding rather than advanced applications
6. Tailor the goal to the student's current level of understanding
7. The goal should be concise (ideally 10-20 words)
